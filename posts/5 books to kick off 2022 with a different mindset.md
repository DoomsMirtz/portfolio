date: 'Dec 7 2021'
excerpt: '2021 have been a low-key for most of us. Read these books to power the beginning of a new year.'

Looking back on 2021, I wish I'd have spent more time reading books rather than doom scrolling. I was in the middle of an existential crisis of my own where there seemed no way to escape it. But as days passed by, things came back to their places and I learned to deal with uncertainty and hopelessness for the first time. Along the way, the driving factor for me was the fact that I had books to read. Looking back in my life, I wasn't an avid reader but then, this pandemic had changed a lot of things. So, I would like to share my curated list of books for all my folks out there who want to start 2022 with a different mindset. Maybe be a little more optimistic about uncertainties and hope for the best.

<br/>

Musk, Elon Musk! is the most celebrated, richest, and successful man in the world right now, the founder of Paypal, SpaceX, Hyperloop, Tesla, and many more. The only man who can take us close to Mars, a life full of inspiration and hard work. The well-known business and technology columnist, **Ashlee Vance**, has put all of these achievements in the most fascinating and adventurous way together in this book. This book takes us through the ups and downs, hard work, struggle, and triumphs of a small-town boy from South Africa who would eventually become the world's most Influential Entrepreneur. Motivation, hard work, consistency, and dominance, these key values drive the whole plot of this critical biography. The book recounts this tightrope act blow by blow to get a glimpse of what it’s like to be Elon Musk. Of the people interviewed for the book — whether they loved or hated Elon — in the end, they were all awed and inspired by him.

# **The Psychology of Money - Morgan Housel**

<br/>

<br/>

As the name suggests it to be another finance book, this book is way more than that. The Psychology of Money by **Morgan Housel** is comfortably the best personal finance and investing book I’ve read. The book consists of 20 short chapters with stories and anecdotes that convey financial and investing lessons. **The underlying premise of the book is that doing well with money has little to do with how smart you are and everything to do with how you behave**. Morgan, previously a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, beautifully describes how the meaning of wealth is not the same for everyone. An event can be a life-changer for one and the same can destroy the other's life. Morgan is a big advocate of multi-disciplinary learning, he frequently reads outside of the topic of finance, on subjects such as Biology, Physics, and history — therefore his lessons and observations apply to multiple fields.

# **Atomic Habits - James Clear**

<br/>

<br/>

You might not believe that small tiny habits can have a significant change in your life. James Clear in his book, Atomic Habits, argues and proves that tiny changes in your life can and will have remarkable results.We convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Actually, the inverse is true: Small improvements accumulate into remarkable results.
Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.

<br/>

Atomic Habits has given me a great overview of the way I am living my life. When practiced right, these tricks to starting new habits can have immeasurable benefits. It’s your turn now. I challenge you to make the most out of these points and start your own atomic habits. **“Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery”**

# **Wrapping up!**
<br/>
The past year has challenged us all to rethink our assumptions about how we work, lead, and plan our lives. I wrote this blog to explore the science of retrospecting our own opinions, opening other people’s minds, and building cultures that prize humility, curiosity, and mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom.
